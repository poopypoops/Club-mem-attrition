b. Overview of the submitted folder and the folder structure. main > src > MLP (machine learning pipeline) main > eda (exploratory data analysis of data)

c. Instructions for executing the pipeline and modifying any parameters. In this project I use python to build and evaluate serveral machine learning models to predict club memebers attrition rate. I adopted the following procedure

Extract the data for the db file downloaded

Preprocess the Data/Clean the Data i.e. remove null values, outlier values, inconsitent values.

Feature Engineering i.e. convert categorical values to numerical values, and removed the

Building the Models

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Model
Boosting Decision Tree
Bagging Decision Tree
Random Forest Model
Support Vector Machine
KNN
Naive Bayes
Evaluating the best model
Based on Accuracy, I then selected the best model

e. Overview of key findings from the EDA

Usage Time and Usage Rate could be used to create another field
Thompson brach had a lower likelihood of attrition
f. Explanation of your choice of models for each machine learning task.

Selected the Models as these were the most common ML models used for classification

g. Evaluation of the models developed. Any metrics used in the evaluation should also be explained.

Accuracy and Recall
